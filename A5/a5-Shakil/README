Purpose: the program will simulate Timmy and Harolds escape through Dragons Hollow, as a variation of the 
client-server architecture. Each instance of the program will use command line arguments to determine 
whether to behave as either a server process which simulates our heroes escape and displays its output, 
or as a client process which connects to a running server in order to receive and display the identical 
escape output.

Source code:

Compilation Command: make

Launching instructions: 
    Program must be launched >1 times,
    1. if launched without any command line arguments, the program will behave as a server
    2. any additional launches must include a command line argument of a valid IP address to connect a
       client to the server Example: ./a5 127.0.0.1
    The server process will run the hollow simulation, and every client process will view the simulation
